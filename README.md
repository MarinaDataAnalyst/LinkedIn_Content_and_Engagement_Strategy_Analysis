# LinkedIn Content & Engagement Strategy Analysis

**Context**
This project presents a data-driven analysis of LinkedIn content performance, audience engagement and follower dynamics for a B2B legal firm operating in an international logistics context.
All data used in this repository has been fully anonymised.

**Objective**
The goal of the analysis was to evaluate how LinkedIn content contributes to audience growth and engagement, and to develop a measurable, evidence-based content strategy aligned with business goals.

## Scope of Analysis

The project covered three complementary areas:
- **Content performance** (posts and engagement metrics)
- **Audience behaviour** (visitors and followers)
- **Campaign impact assessment** over multiple time periods

The analysis was conducted across **three comparable cohorts**, allowing both baseline comparison and post-campaign evaluation.

## Key Business Questions Addressed

- Which types of content generate higher engagement and click-through rates?
- How does posting frequency and consistency affect visibility and audience growth?
- Are there observable differences between baseline and campaign periods?
- How does content performance relate to changes in visitors and followers over time?
- What level of data volume is required for statistically reliable optimisation?
