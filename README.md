## Project timeline: 3 months.

Based on the initial meeting, the questions asked and the answers received, a project development option was proposed through structuring the publication of posts on LinkedIn. I prepared a presentation on the stages and essence of the project, and also defined the roles, taking into account the motivation of the other 2 team members.

**Identified target:**  to improve Marketing and Sales and attract  premium customers.
**Budget:** 0.

**Roles:**
- my role is a leader, communication with the client, data scraper and analyst
- the role of the second participant is a data analyst (based on his own motivation)
- the role of the third participant is a digital marketing specialist

 
Data was processed from LinkedIn Analytics. In general I did 13 projects. The final project included 3 parts: main Exploratory and giving insights and summary project with visualisation in Tableau and presentation of thoughts in PowerPoint, then A/B tests and SQL query tasks.

Achieved results and skills: 
* Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, pymystem3, scipy, sklearn);
* SQL(PostgreSQL);
* Extracting and cleansing Data;
* Exploratory Data Analysing, decomposing;
* Statistical Data Analysis;
